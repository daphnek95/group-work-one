            <h2 class="body-title">About Harry</h2>
              <p>Harry James Potter is the main character in a wildly popular serious of novels written by J.K. Rowling. Harry is a half-blood wizard, the only child and son of the late James and Lily Potter, and one of the most famous wizards of modern times.</p>

              <p>In what proved to be a vain attempt to circumvent a prophecy that stated a boy born at the end of July of 1980 could be able to defeat him, Lord Voldemort tried to murder him when he was a year and three months old. Voldemort murdered Harry's parents as they tried to protect him, shortly before attacking Harry. This early, unsuccessful attempt to vanquish Harry led to Voldemort's first downfall, marking the end of the First Wizarding War and to Harry henceforth being known as the "Boy Who Lived.  </p>

        <h2>Hedwig</h2>
        <p> Harry Potter's faithful messenger and pet snowy owl in the Harry Potter novels by J. K. Rowling. 
          Hedwig, the snowy owl from the Harry Potter movies, was actually played by seven different birds over the course of the franchise.
          Author J.K. Rowling has spoken about some inaccuracies she made in writing about the snowy owl in the books.
          "I made a few elementary mistakes when it came to my depiction of Hedwig," she said per Pottermore. 
          "Firstly, Snowy Owls are diurnal (i.e., they fly by day). Secondly, they are virtually mute, so Hedwig's 
          frequent hoots and chirrups of approval and comfort should be taken as signs of her magically enhanced abilities. 
          Thirdly, as countless well-meaning owl-lovers and experts kept writing to me in the early days, owls do not eat bacon 
          (Hedwig enjoys a bit of bacon rind when she delivers post at breakfast)."
